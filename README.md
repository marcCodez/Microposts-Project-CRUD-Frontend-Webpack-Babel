This project is basically a full stack application by working with the JSON server backend, it mimics a complete REST API using a JSON file allowing you to run/stop the server and view your data. The documentation can be read here: https://github.com/typicode/json-server. It is a flexible tool allowing you to create any kind of data structure (users, posts etc.) you want which makes it more flexible than using a remote service. When we run the server all our resources will be on localhost:3000 and you can make all of these requests to this back end API. Babel is utilised to transpile ES6 down to regular ES5 code in order to utilise modules. Webpack provides a nice workflow so that we can use NPM(Node Package Manager) to create static assets. The webpack dev server will allow us to run an autoload server in the browser while we create the application.
